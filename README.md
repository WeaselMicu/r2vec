# This package is almost completely superceded by the [text2vec package](https://github.com/dselivanov/text2vec)
I may continue some prototyping of ideas here, but text2vec does almost everything I wanted to do with r2vec, and does it much better.  I suggest starting there for text mining in R.

## r2vec
See also text2vec on [github](https://github.com/dselivanov/text2vec) and [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/text2vec/index.html).

Tools for vectorizing text data in R.  Currently supports bag-of-words, bag-of-n-grams, and bag-of-skip-grams vectorization.  Includes predict funtions, which are useful for applying vectorizations to new data.
